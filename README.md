# Project 1 - The Last Rebellion
The Last Rebellion

Inspired by a classic 1970s arcade game, this version is themed after Star Wars. The player starts as Millenium Falcon, stuck in a shooting frenzy with swarms of Tie Fighters. The objective is to defeat the Imperials by firing lasers and survive by tactfully avoiding theirs.
