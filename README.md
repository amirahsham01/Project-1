# Project 1 - The Last Rebellion

<a href="http://https://amirahsham01.github.io/proj1-last-rebellion/">The Last Rebellion</a>

An adaptation of a classic 1970s arcade game, this version is themed after Star Wars. The player starts as Millenium Falcon, stuck in a shooting frenzy with swarms of Tie Interceptors. The objective is to defeat the Imperials by firing lasers and survive by tactfully avoiding theirs.
